 Typecript = Javascript + A type System

#

 ## The TS Type Sytem
 - Hepls us catch erros during development
 - Uses "type annotations" to analyze our code
 - Only active during development 
 - Doesn't provide any performance optimization 

#

Typescript code (javascript with type annotations)
Typescript compiler
Plain old javascript
- TS compiler online: typescriptlanf.org/play

#

- Writing Typescript is the same as writing Javascript with some "extra documentation"
- Typecript has no effect on how our code gets executed the browser or Node
- It is best to think of Typescript as being like a friend sitting behind you while you are coding
